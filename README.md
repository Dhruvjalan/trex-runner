# The Classic T-Rex Game
## Now enjoy it Online!

This is one of my first personal projects I made from Javascript. It is the classic google T-rex Game, but Online! 

## How to play?
Same as before.
Hit the space bar to jump above the obsacles and try to jump over as many as possible. Once you get hit, you DIE. 

## Improvisations:
1. Make the game faster as the score increases.
2. Add a highscore
3. Add bird obstacles.

## To Play:
Nothing much
1. Either download the code, unzip it and run it in an IDE.
   or
2. Click on the link (https://dhruvjalan.github.io/trex-runner/). get it from settings>
